	The purpose of filesplit.exe is to parse records from one or more files, 
which may contain multiple people with the same phone number, and distrubute 
those records among several files according to successive instances of each
unique phone number.
 
	For a given source  file "example.csv," a file "example._1.csv" would be
created containing only records with the first instance of each unique 
phone number.  A file called "example_2.csv" would contain any second number
instances, and so on up to a maximum specified via at runtime (default is 6). 
After parsing, the source file is renamed with the .OLD extension appended.

	Source data files must be delimited text with either comma, tab, colon, 
semi-colon, or pipe as the delimiter.  They must have a .3 character extension 
but no specific extension is required. The delimiter is assumed to be comma
unless a runtime argument specifies otherwise. 

	Command line arguments passed at runtime arguments specify the target file
(or group of files matched via wildcards * or ?), the file's delimiter, and 
other options.  These can also be vewed by running filesplit.exe -h

Usage: filesplit.exe [options]

Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -f <FILE-PATH>, --file=<FILE-PATH>
                         (REQUIRED)Specify SOURCE FILE containing data.   May
                        be absolute or relative path.
  -d <DELIMITER-CHAR>, --delimiter=<DELIMITER-CHAR>
                        Specify DELIMITER in source data from among , | : or ;
                        \N(Default is comma) use -t argument for TAB
  -t, --tab_delim       Specify DELIMITER in source data from as TAB
  -p <HEADER-STRING>, --phone_header=<HEADER-STRING>
                        Specify the Header String for the PHONE NUMBER column.
                        -p takes precedence over -c if both are passed.
  -c <INTEGER>, --phone_column=<INTEGER>
                        If headers are absent, specify the number of the PHONE
                        NUMBER column. (Without header, defailt is 3)
  -e, --erase           ERASES records from SOURCE FILE when finished.
  -m <INTEGER>, --max_instances=<INTEGER>
                        Sets the upper limit on duplicate PHONE NUMBER
                        instances. (Default is 6)
  -w, --write_all       Create output files up to max instances even if empty.
                        (Default False)
