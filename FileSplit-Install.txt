*****************************OVERVIEW**********************************
Enclosed in this archive are a batch sctipt, lunch.bat, an empty folder called "Files"
and a folder containing the executable filesplit.exe and its supporting files. 

"lunch.bat" contains various directory paths and configuration data 
specific to your environment, and commands to call first call filesplit.exe  
to process your cafe balance files into seperate files for succesive phone 
number instances, rename the original files with the .OLD suffix appended, 
then call the ALF to launch seperate broadcasts to each file sequentially. 
Thus calls will be made on a student by studen basis rather than on a 
unique phone number basis.

Before use, the ALF will need to be configured for several lunch balance calls 
for each school, one for each of the files creaated by filesplit.exe. Within 
the ALF Config Tool, the lunch broadcasts must have sequential config IDs, and 
the sequence must be the same from one school to the next.  If this is not 
practical, seperate scheduled tasks may be created for finer control over the 
ALF broadcasts.


*******************************SETUP**********************************
The lunch.bat has already been configured for the file locations and names 
you privided to SchoolReach.  So setup is fairly minimal.

1)	Place the contents of this folder (lunch.bat, and the two folders)
	in C:\SchoolReach\AutoLaunchFacillitator\

2) 	In the File Splitter folder, double click on dryrun.bat
	This will move your cafe balance files to the "Files" folder, then
	will run filesplit.exe with the same options as lunch.bat, but will 
	not rename the source files nor run the ALF.

3)	Run the ALF Config Tool to point a broadcast at each of the generated 
    	files for each school in Files. Make sure that the sequence of ID's is the same
	for each school. For example, if one school has lunch calls with IDs 1A0-1A4, 
	the next school's ID's should be 2A0-2A4, and so on.
	
4)	Set up a Scheduled Task to run lunch.bat at the time you wish the lunch
    	balance calls to begin.
